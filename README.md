### Well, just as much as a portfolio is about demonstrating your skills, it’s about showing who you are. People follow your blog because they appreciate your content. Recruiters hire you because they think that you as a person would fit their culture. Not just because you demonstrate excellent technical skills.

### During the development of this app I mastered:
- something in CSS
- GULP
- BEM
- flex

### You can run this project locally, just open `index.html` in browser.
